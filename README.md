Steganography Project
This repository contains a Steganography application developed in C programming. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. This project demonstrates how data can be securely hidden within an image file.

Features
Encode a secret message into an image file.
Decode the hidden message from the image file.
Simple and efficient implementation using C.
Lightweight and fast execution.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Concepts: File I/O, Bitwise Operations, Data Encoding, and Decoding
How to Run
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/steganography.git
cd steganography
Compile the Code: Use a C compiler such as gcc to compile the program:

bash
Copy code
gcc -o steganography steganography.c
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
./steganography
Follow the Prompts:

Provide the image file and the secret message for encoding.
Or, provide the image file to decode the hidden message.
Example Usage
Encoding a Message:
Input: A cover image (e.g., cover_image.bmp) and a secret message.
Output: A new image with the hidden message (e.g., stego_image.bmp).
Decoding a Message:
Input: The stego image with the hidden message (e.g., stego_image.bmp).
Output: The extracted secret message.

Prerequisites
A working C compiler (e.g., GCC).
An image in BMP format (other formats can be added with further development).
Future Enhancements
Support for additional image formats (e.g., PNG, JPG).

Improved error handling and validation.
Add encryption to the hidden message for enhanced security.
